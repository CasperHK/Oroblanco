# Oroblanco
Oroblanco is a full-stack web development framework built in Ballerina, designed to merge Laravel’s developer-friendly philosophy with Ballerina’s performance and concurrency strengths. It natively integrates with leading JavaScript frontend frameworks—Next.js, Nuxt.js, and SvelteKit—enabling seamless full-stack development, while using TOML for lightweight, human-readable configuration. Oroblanco aims to deliver a high-performance, cloud-native solution for building modern web applications.

## Goals
1. **Unified Full-Stack Experience:** Bridge backend (Ballerina) and frontend (Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit) with native interoperability.
2. **Performance:** Leverage Ballerina’s compiled execution and concurrency for fast, scalable backends.
3. **Cloud-Native:** Optimize for microservices, serverless, and distributed systems.
4. **Developer Productivity:** Provide intuitive tools and TOML-based configuration for rapid development.
5. **Ecosystem Growth:** Foster a modular, extensible framework with community contributions.
